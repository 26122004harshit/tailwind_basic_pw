                    creation myth </b> writ large:
                Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to
                rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the
                world's most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal
                computing, animated movies, music,phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He
                thus belongs in the pantheon ofAmerica's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and
                Walt Disney. None of these men wasa saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history
                will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>

                    One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of the book, I asked him again
                    about his tendency to be rough on people. "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart
                    people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling
                    brutalized. But they don't." Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, "And we
                    got some amazing things done." Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen
                    years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod
                    nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention every
                    Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of
                    colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.
